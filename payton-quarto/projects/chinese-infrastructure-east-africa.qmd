            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
              This paper examines the economic impact of Chinese-funded road infrastructure projects across five East African countries — Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda — using nighttime light (NTL) intensity as a proxy for local economic development. China has invested heavily in these nations' road networks, largely to facilitate access to the Democratic Republic of Congo's critical mineral resources, particularly cobalt, which China controls roughly 80% of global exports of.
            </p>
            <p>
              Rather than accepting the geopolitical narratives dominating the literature, this study asks a simpler empirical question: do these roads actually improve living standards in the surrounding communities?
            </p>

          <div class="project-section fade-up">
            <h2>Data &amp; Methodology</h2>
            <p>
              Road project locations, start dates, and completion dates were sourced from AidData at William &amp; Mary, filtered to transportation and storage projects, then manually verified and coded in QGIS using OpenStreetMaps and Google Maps cross-referencing. Administrative boundaries for 816 districts across the five countries were pulled from GADM.
            </p>
            <p>
              Nighttime light luminosity data was drawn from two satellite missions: DMSP-OLS (2001–2010) and VIIRS Day/Night Band (2011–2024). District-level mean luminosity was extracted for each year, then merged with hub-distance calculations from each district centroid to the nearest road segment — before and after project completion.
            </p>
            <p>
              The core model is a <strong>two-way fixed effects (TWFE)</strong> difference-in-differences design, comparing treated districts (those near completed road projects) against untreated ones, controlling for both district and year fixed effects. An event study framework is also employed to examine pre- and post-treatment trends and test the parallel trends assumption.

            <h2>Key Findings</h2>
            <p>
              Across all model specifications, the treatment effect — road project completion — was associated with <strong>negative or negligible changes in nighttime light luminosity</strong>. The post-treatment coefficient in the two-way fixed effects model was −4.84 (after project completion) and −4.15 (after project start), though lacking statistical significance at conventional levels.
            </p>
            <p>
              When filtered for districts within 5 kilometers of a completed road, the adverse effect grew in magnitude (Post-Treatment: −13.8), suggesting that communities closest to these projects may see the sharpest relative declines. Event study results further showed that pre-treatment luminosity trends do not align with what would be expected under parallel trends, complicating causal identification.
            </p>
            <p>
              Of the three hypotheses tested, none were straightforwardly confirmed. H1 (positive economic outcomes) was not supported. H2 (asymmetric benefits) was partially supported, though the asymmetry ran in a negative direction. H3 (greater impact in less-developed communities) could not be adequately tested given the concentration of projects in already-urbanized districts.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="project-section fade-up">
            <h2>Discussion &amp; Implications</h2>
            <p>
              The results do not support a simple "debt-trap diplomacy" reading. Instead, several mechanisms may explain the null or negative findings. Many projects upgraded existing unpaved routes rather than opening new corridors, limiting their market-access impact. New roads may also accelerate rural-to-urban migration, depressing luminosity in origin districts. Increased market competition from better-connected supply chains could erode local monopolies. And in countries with unstable energy infrastructure, road construction alone cannot generate development without complementary investment.
            </p>
            <p>
              A key implication is that infrastructure investment — regardless of funder — should be preceded not just by engineering feasibility studies but by rigorous analysis of economic potential and community impact. China's BRI appears to prioritize geopolitical and resource-access goals over measurable development outcomes, which weakens the aid's long-term legitimacy and accountability.
