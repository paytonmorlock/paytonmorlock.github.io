            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
              Corrections spending — covering police, prisons, and incarceration infrastructure — has become one of the most politically charged line items in state budgets. Republicans have consistently campaigned on "tough on crime" platforms, while Democrats have increasingly positioned themselves as advocates for criminal justice reform. But does party affiliation in office actually translate into measurable differences in spending?
            </p>
            <p>
              This paper exploits the quasi-random nature of <strong>close gubernatorial elections</strong> (decided within a 5% margin) from 1977 to 2022 as a natural experiment. Using regression discontinuity design (RDD), it estimates the causal effect of a Democratic versus Republican governor winning a tight race on corrections spending as a share of total state expenditures.
            </p>
          </div>

            <h2>Data &amp; Design</h2>
            <p>
              Two datasets were combined: gubernatorial election results from the Harvard Dataverse replication data for Algara &amp; Amlani (2021), and corrections spending as a fraction of total state expenditures from the Urban Institute's State and Local Government Finance Data Tool. After filtering for close elections (absolute win margin ≤ 5%) within the 1977–2022 window, 538 elections were identified, of which 119 matched to corrections spending data.
            </p>
            <p>
              A <strong>sharp regression discontinuity design</strong> is used, with the Democratic margin of victory as the running variable and a cutoff at zero (50% of votes). The treatment is a Democratic win. The outcome is state corrections spending as a proportion of total expenditures. A McCrary density test confirmed no significant manipulation of the running variable near the cutoff, supporting the assumption of near-random treatment assignment.
            </p>
            <p>
              Bandwidth was optimized using CERRD (Coverage Error Rate optimal bandwidth), yielding an optimal bandwidth of 0.007. Robustness checks include bandwidth sensitivity analysis and polynomial order checks (linear through quartic), all of which produced stable estimates.
            </p>

            <h2>Key Findings</h2>
            <p>
              The results are consistent with the hypothesis — but with a counterintuitive twist. <strong>Democratic governors winning close elections modestly increase corrections spending</strong>, while Republican governors who narrowly win actually decrease it. The local average treatment effect (LATE) is approximately <strong>0.2 percentage points</strong> — a small but non-trivial amount given the scale of state budgets.
            </p>
            <p>
              This pattern holds across linear, quadratic, cubic, and quartic model specifications, with coefficients remaining stable at 0.002 throughout. The win margin itself had a larger effect on corrections spending than party affiliation alone, suggesting that <strong>electoral mandate size matters</strong> — governors with narrow victories may respond differently to median voter pressure than those with commanding leads.
            </p>
            <p>
              The finding that Democrats increase spending and Republicans decrease it runs against conventional "tough on crime" rhetoric. One interpretation: Democratic governors winning narrow races perceive their electorates as more moderate and adjust budgets to signal toughness on crime. Republican governors, closer to a base that favors fiscal restraint, may prioritize cutting spending even on law enforcement.

            <h2>Implications</h2>
            <p>
              The findings suggest that budgetary decisions on corrections are shaped meaningfully by <strong>electoral incentives</strong> as much as ideological commitment. When governors are acutely aware of a narrow mandate, they appear to adjust spending to satisfy perceived median voter preferences — which may actually align more closely with moderate corrections spending than party platforms suggest.
            </p>
            <p>
              This has practical implications for criminal justice reform advocates. Rather than assuming partisan affiliation determines corrections budgets, advocates may find more traction focusing on electoral conditions — particularly in swing states with historically close gubernatorial races. More broadly, it raises questions about whether a more technocratic, evidence-based approach to corrections budgeting would produce better outcomes than one driven by electoral cycles.
